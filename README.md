# UpStake

## About the project

UpStake is a burnable token; price increases as supply decreases. Using a unique exchange concept, tokens increase in value every hour and can be bought or sold on a first-come-first-served basis. UpStake tokens can also be used to purchase UpStake investment products such as UpStake Edge and in the future exchanged for real goods and services or for peer-to-peer transactions.

## Token Distribution Timeline

#### Stage 1 (completed)
- Mint 5.5 million UPS tokens to ensure fixed supply limit [Verify UpStake token supply on etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/token/ "UpStake Master Wallet")

#### Stage 2 (Q1 2019)
- Tokens burnt
- Members issued unique ERC20 wallet
- Tokens distributed to member wallets
- All UPS transactions tracked on open ledger

## Token Features

The token is an implementation of ERC20 standard. All the operations are done using the smallest indivisible token unit. Just as on Ethereum all the operations are done in wei. 

### Highlights
- The SafeMath library.
- Empty constructor. It cannot be changed forever once initialized.

### Maximum Supply
5.5 million tokens initially minted, this number can never increase but will decrease when tokens are burnt ensuring scarcity will rise over time.

### Burnable Token
Tokens can be irreversibly burned (destroyed). We burn a specific amount of tokens from the target address and decrement allowance from the address which sends tokens thus reducing the overall supply. 1% of tokens are bunt during exchange transactions and 90% are burnt when an UpStake Edge is created. UpStake has the ability to adjust the burn rate on products.

### Exchangeable Token
Tokens can be traded between two addresses on the UpStake exchange only.
